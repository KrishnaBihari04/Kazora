Kazora


Kazora is a fullâ€“stack web project I created as my final assignment for the first year of my Software Development studies. The challenge was to build a complete website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL â€” and I took on the entire project solo.

Iâ€™m proud to share that this project earned me the highest grade in the class ðŸŽ‰.


ðŸ”Ž About the Project:

Kazora is designed as a modern, stylish website that combines:

Frontend: clean UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Backend: dynamic PHP pages and MySQL database integration.
Features: user registration, login, product management, account handling, and review functionality.

The website blends functionality with design, aiming for a professional yet approachable look.

ðŸš€ What I Learned

This project pushed me to:

Structure a full project from scratch.
Write secure and maintainable PHP code.
Design and query relational databases with SQL.
Build responsive layouts with CSS and Bootstrap.
Debug and solve problems independently.


ðŸ“‚ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Backend: PHP
Database: MySQL

ðŸ’¡ Reflection
Kazora is more than just an assignment â€” itâ€™s a milestone. It shows how far Iâ€™ve come in one year of coding, and it motivates me to keep pushing my skills further.
